# Datascape

Data scape is a stock price CRUD tool that allows users to create a 'scape' that shows a company's stock index and start and end dates. 

I'm working on adding an external API fetch that pulls down the company's actual stock prices for those days and will integrate a data visualization library to add on a pretty graph. 

Down the road, I'd like to add in another external API that illustrates the company's main S&P industry indices to help show the user how a company is doing against their competitors.
